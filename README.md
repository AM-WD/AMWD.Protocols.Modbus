# Modbus Protocol for .NET

Here you can find a basic implementation of the Modbus protocol.

## Package Overview

The project is divided into three parts.

To be mentioned at the beginning:    
Only the clients are build very modular to fit any requirement reached on the first implementation back in 2018 ([see here](https://github.com/andreasAmMueller/Modbus)).    
The server implementations will only cover their defaults!



### Common

Here you'll find all the common interfaces and base implementations for Modbus.

For example the default protocol versions: `TCP`, `RTU` and `ASCII`.



### Serial

Here you'll find all the serial protocol implementations.



### TCP

Here you'll find all the TCP protocol implementations.
